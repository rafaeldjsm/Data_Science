# Can you find a better way to segment your customers?

## ðŸ“– Background
You work for a medical device manufacturer in Switzerland. Your company manufactures orthopedic devices and sells them worldwide. The company sells directly to individual doctors who use them on rehabilitation and physical therapy patients.

Historically, the sales and customer support departments have grouped doctors by geography. However, the region is not a good predictor of the number of purchases a doctor will make or their support needs.

Your team wants to use a data-centric approach to segmenting doctors to improve marketing, customer service, and product planning.

**Sumary**:

1. Imports\
	1.1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. How many doctors are there in each region? What is the average number of purchases per region?
3. Can you find a relationship between purchases and complaints?
4. Define new doctor segments that help the company improve marketing efforts and customer service.
5. Identify which features impact the new segmentation strategy the most.

**This notebook aims to analyze the content of the customer database, indicating the main metrics that can be effective for the best marketing targeting. Based on this analysis, I develop a model that allows the clustering of doctors according to their intention to execute purchase orders, as well as their level of satisfaction, complaints and reworks.**
